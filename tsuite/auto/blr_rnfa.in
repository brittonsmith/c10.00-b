This is the lower density cloud computed in Rees et al. (1989). 
Table 1 of that paper lists the predictions, which were a mean of those
of Hagai Netzer's ION and roughly version 76 of CLOUDY.  The lines
are generally still in good agreement with the predictions of that paper. 
In particular the changes in the line fluxes shown in Figure 1
of that paper are reproduced quite well.
