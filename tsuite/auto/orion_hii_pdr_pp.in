title the Orion HII Region / PDR / Molecular cloud with an open geometry
c
c commands controlling continuum =========
c the incident continuum has two parts
c kurucz continuum with flux of photons striking cloud
c this is the the OVI star, its temperature and phi(H)
c this is the result of this command
c table star kurucz 39600 K
c and makes it possible to run these orion sims without
c installing the stellar atmosphere files 
table read "star_kurucz_39600.dat" 
phi(H) 13
c
c this adds the observed hot brems
c its temperature (as log of T) and the flux of 
c photons striking the cloud
brems 6
phi(h) 10
c
c cosmic rays are important for pdr chemistry
cosmic rays, background
c
c commands controlling geometry  =========
c this turns off the stop temperature option
c so the sim will not stop due to temperature
stop temperature off
c this sets the thickness of the HII region & PDR
//>>chng 05 nov 22, change from 1 to 1/2 pc to avoid strong freeze out
// of molecules
stop thickness 0.5 linear parsec 
c this is typical of a gmc, larson 1981
c stop total hydrogen column density 22
c this will result in a milli gauss B-field in molecular region
magnetic field -5 gauss
c assume constant pressure
constant pressure 
//>>chng 05 nov 18, add this, NA add two ices
set nend 2000 
c
c other commands for details     =========
failures 3
c mimic existence of unmodeled molecular gas
double 
c iterate since lines optically thick
iterate
c set microturbulence in equipartition with B field
turbulence equipartition
c set the line width so lines appear on the save continuum
c set save line width 10 km/s
c
c commands for density & abundances =========
c this is the log of the initial H density, cm-3
hden 4
c this will speed up the calculation a bit
init file="ism.ini"
c this uses HII region abundances, but no grains
abundances hii region no grains
c this uses orion grains
grains orion
c turn on PAHs, with an abundance that depends on H0 fraction,
c as suggested by long-slit observations of Orion bar,
c with an abundance 3x larger than default built into the code
grains pah function 3 
c 
c commands controlling output    =========
c print lots of faint CO lines
print line faint -6
c normalize to Ha
normalize to "H  1" 6563

c ========================================

Similar to orion_hii_pdr except for plane parallel geometry.
The properties of the molecular region change when details of the H+
region change because the pressure of the entire cloud can change
as a result.  The goal of this sim is an existence proof - that it can
be done, rather than the stable details of the molecular region.
