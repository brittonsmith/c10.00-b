c ========================================

This is a dense ISM exposed to a cool blackbody.  This tests the
ability to converge onto a VERY molecular environment.  Nearly all
C and H are in CO and H2.  Cosmic rays are the main source of
heat and ionization.

Continuum pumping of CO followed by collisional deexcitation is a
major heating agent across the sim.
