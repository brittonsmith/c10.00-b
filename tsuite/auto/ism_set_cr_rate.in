c commands controlling continuum =========
cosmic ray rate -16
c this will be VERY faint black 50000
ionization parameter -25
black 50000

c commands for density & abundances =========
hden 5
element hydrogen ionization 1 0.00000001

c commands controlling geometry  =========
set dr 0 
stop zone 1
c
c other commands for details     =========
constant temperature 1000 K
c turn off molecules to test only ions 
no molecules 
c must turn off charge transfer and its heating, which would dominate,
c since we want to test cr heating and ionization
no charge transfer
no ctheat
c must turn of  photoionization by recombining species,
c since we want to test cr heating and ionization
no photoionization
c any time photoionization is turned off, it is best to also
c turn off induced processes, which include pumping in the lyman lines
no induced processes

This test conditions of cosmic ray ionization.  Molecules and charge transfer
are disabled so that analytical estimates can be made.
