</TD></TR><TR><TD>2</TD><TD>radius_next.c</TD><TD>6</TD><TD>- this routine is very important since it sets the pace for the calculation, and directly affects the convergence of the code.  Most of the logic is very old and  messy.    1) make sure all test cases have punch dr  2) cat all these reasons together into one file and sort on the reason  3) discover what logic is the main pacesetter for the code  4) which are never triggered and so can be removed

</TD></TR><TR><TD>2</TD><TD>rt_diffuse.c</TD><TD>396</TD><TD>should use ConEmitLocal for all continua, but not followed by DiffuseEscape - put that at the end.  Once continua all  bundled this way, it will be easy to save them as a function  of depth and then do exact rt
