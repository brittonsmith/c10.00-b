# fits for colllisional rates within H2
# >>refer	H2	coll Hp	Gerlich, D., 1990, J. Chem. Phys., 92, 2377-2388
#rate(up -> low) = k0 * exp( -delta E/kT ), k0 = a[0] *1e-10 cm^3 s^-1, a[1] is dE in milli Ev 
#
# NB - this data has been fit with a different equation from the other 4
# the last zero is to be parallel with the other data files but is not used
# the following are the downward collision rates, which we use.  He also gives upward rates,
# which are at the end of this file, but they are not in detailed balance with the downward
# rates.  Something is seriously wrong with the paper.
